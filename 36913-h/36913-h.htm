<I>When twilight flutters the mountains over,<BR>
The faery lights from the earth unfold:<BR>
And over the caves enchanted hover<BR>
The giant heroes and gods of old.<BR>
The bird of æther its flaming pinions<BR>
Waves over earth the whole night long:<BR>
The stars drop down in their blue dominions<BR>
To hymn together their choral song.<BR>
The child of earth in his heart grows burning,<BR>
Mad for the night and the deep unknown;<BR>
His alien flame in a dream returning<BR>
Seats itself on the ancient throne.<BR>
When twilight over the mountains fluttered,<BR>
And night with its starry millions came,<BR>
I too had dreams: the songs I have uttered<BR>
Come from this heart that was touched by the flame.</I><BR>

  THE DIVINE VISION
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
This mood hath known all beauty, for it sees<BR>
O'erwhelmed majesties<BR>
In these pale forms, and kingly crowns of gold<BR>
On brows no longer bold,<BR>
And through the shadowy terrors of their hell<BR>
The love for which they fell.<BR>
And how desire which cast them in the deep<BR>
Called God too from His sleep.<BR>
Oh, pity, only seer, who looking through<BR>
A heart melted like dew,<BR>
Seest the long perished in the present thus,<BR>
For ever dwell in us.<BR>
Whatever time thy golden eyelids ope<BR>
They travel to a hope;<BR>
Not only backward from these low degrees<BR>
To starry dynasties,<BR>
But, looking far where now the silence owns<BR>
And rules from empty thrones,<BR>
Thou seest the enchanted hills of heaven burn<BR>
For joy at our return.<BR>
Thy tender kiss hath memory we are kings<BR>
For all our wanderings.<BR>
Thy shining eyes already see the after<BR>
In hidden light and laughter.<BR>

THE GATES OF DREAMLAND<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
It's a lonely road through bogland to the lake at Carrowmore,<BR>
And a sleeper there lies dreaming where the water laps the shore;<BR>
Though the moth-wings of the twilight in their purples are unfurled,<BR>
Yet his sleep is filled with music by the masters of the world.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
There's a hand is white as silver that is fondling with his hair:<BR>
There are glimmering feet of sunshine that are dancing by him there:<BR>
And half-open lips of faery that were dyed a faery red<BR>
In their revels where the Hazel Tree its holy clusters shed.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
"Come away," the red lips whisper, "all the world is weary now;<BR>
'Tis the twilight of the ages and it's time to quit the plough.<BR>
Oh, the very sunlight's weary ere it lightens up the dew,<BR>
And its gold is changed and faded before it falls to you.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
"Though your colleen's heart be tender, a tenderer heart is near.<BR>
What's the starlight in her glances when the stars are shining clear?<BR>
Who would kiss the fading shadow when the flower-face glows above?<BR>
'Tis the Beauty of all Beauty that is calling for your love."<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Oh, the great gates of the mountain have opened once again,<BR>
And the sound of song and dancing falls upon the ears of men,<BR>
And the Land of Youth lies gleaming flushed with rainbow light and mirth,<BR>
And the old enchantment lingers in the honey-heart of earth.<BR>

FREEDOM<BR>

I will not follow you, my bird,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not follow you.<BR>
I would not breathe a word, my bird,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To bring thee here anew.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
I love the free in thee, my bird,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lure of freedom drew;<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
And there we yet will meet, my bird,<BR>

Where in the light outpoured, my bird,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are love and freedom too.<BR>

THE MASTER SINGER<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
A laughter in the diamond air, a music in the trembling grass;<BR>
And one by one the words of light as joydrops through my being pass:<BR>
"I am the sunlight in the heart, the silver moon-glow in the mind;<BR>
My laughter runs and ripples through the wavy tresses of the wind.<BR>
I am the fire upon the hills, the dancing flame that leads afar<BR>
Each burning hearted wanderer, and I the dear and homeward star.<BR>
A myriad lovers died for me, and in their latest yielded breath<BR>
I woke in glory giving them immortal life though touched by death.<BR>
They knew me from the dawn of time: if Hermes beats his rainbow wings,<BR>
If Angus shakes his locks of light, or golden-haired Apollo sings,<BR>
It matters not the name, the land: my joy in all the Gods abides:<BR>
Even in the cricket in the grass some dimness of me smiles and hides.<BR>
For joy of me the daystar glows, and in delight and wild desire<BR>
The peacock twilight rays aloft its plumes and blooms of shadowy fire,<BR>
Where in the vastness too I burn through summer nights and ages long,<BR>
And with the fiery-footed watchers shake in myriad dance and song."<BR>

REMEMBRANCE<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
There were many burning hours on the heart-sweet tide,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And we passed away from ourselves, forgetting all<BR>
The immortal moods that faded, the god who died,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hastening away to the King on a distant call.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
There were ruby dews were shed when the heart was riven,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And passionate pleading and prayers to the dead we had wronged;<BR>
And we passed away, unremembering and unforgiven,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hastening away to the King for the peace we longed.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Love unremembered and heart-ache we left behind,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We forsook them, unheeding, hastening away in our flight;<BR>
We knew the hearts we had wronged of old we would find<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we came to the fold of the King for rest in the night.<BR>

DANA<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
I am the tender voice calling "Away,"<BR>
Whispering between the beatings of the heart,<BR>
And inaccessible in dewy eyes<BR>
I dwell, and all unkissed on lovely lips,<BR>
Lingering between white breasts inviolate,<BR>
And fleeting ever from the passionate touch,<BR>
I shine afar, till men may not divine<BR>
Whether it is the stars or the beloved<BR>
They follow with rapt spirit.  And I weave<BR>
My spells at evening, folding with dim caress,<BR>
Aerial arms and twilight dropping hair,<BR>
The lonely wanderer by wood or shore,<BR>
Till, filled with some deep tenderness, he yields,<BR>
Feeling in dreams for the dear mother heart<BR>
He knew, ere he forsook the starry way,<BR>
And clings there, pillowed far above the smoke<BR>
And the dim murmur from the duns of men.<BR>
I can enchant the trees and rocks, and fill<BR>
The dumb brown lips of earth with mystery,<BR>
Make them reveal or hide the god.  I breathe<BR>
A deeper pity than all love, myself<BR>
Mother of all, but without hands to heal:<BR>
Too vast and vague, they know me not.  But yet,<BR>
I am the heartbreak over fallen things,<BR>
The sudden gentleness that stays the blow,<BR>
And I am in the kiss that foemen give<BR>
Pausing in battle, and in the tears that fall<BR>
Over the vanquished foe, and in the highest,<BR>
Among the Danaan gods, I am the last<BR>
Council of mercy in their hearts where they<BR>
Mete justice from a thousand starry thrones.<BR>

THE GREY EROS<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
We are desert leagues apart;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time is misty ages now<BR>
Since the warmth of heart to heart<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chased the shadows from my brow.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Oh, I am so old, meseems<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am next of kin to Time,<BR>
The historian of her dreams<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the long-forgotten prime.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
You have come a path of flowers.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What a way was mine to roam!<BR>
Many a fallen empire's towers,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many a ruined heart my home.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
No, there is no comfort, none.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the dewy tender breath<BR>
Idly falls when life is done<BR>

Though the dream of love may tire,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the ages long agone<BR>
There were ruby hearts of fire&mdash;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, the daughters of the dawn!<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
Though I am so feeble now,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember when our pride<BR>
Could not to the Mighty bow;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would sweep His stars aside.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
Mix thy youth with thoughts like those&mdash;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It were but to wither thee,<BR>
But to graft the youthful rose<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the old and flowerless tree.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Age is no more near than youth<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the sceptre and the crown.<BR>

But sometimes when your wings would rest,<BR>

  THE NUTS OF KNOWLEDGE

<P CLASS="poem">
A cabin on the mountain side hid in a grassy nook<BR>
Where door and windows open wide that friendly stars may look.<BR>
The rabbit shy can patter in, the winds may enter free,<BR>
Who throng around the mountain throne in living ecstasy.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
And when the sun sets dimmed in eve and purple fills the air,<BR>
I think the sacred Hazel Tree is dropping berries there<BR>
From starry fruitage waved aloft where Connla's Well o'erflows;<BR>
For sure the enchanted waters run through every wind that blows.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
I think when night towers up aloft and shakes the trembling dew,<BR>
How every high and lonely thought that thrills my being through<BR>
Is but a ruddy berry dropped down through the purple air,<BR>
And from the magic tree of life the fruit falls everywhere.<BR>

Oh, what is worth this lore of age<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If time shall never bring us back<BR>
Our battle with the gods to wage<BR>

The battle rapture here goes by<BR>
In warring upon things that die.<BR>

Let be the tale of him whose love<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was sighed between white Deirdre's breasts,<BR>
It will not lift the heart above<BR>

Love once had power the gods to bring<BR>
All rapt on its wild wandering.<BR>

We shiver in the falling dew,<BR>

A hearth fire blazing through it all,<BR>
A home without a circling wall.<BR>

The shepherd stars have shrunk within,<BR>
The world's great night will soon begin.<BR>

It left to-day and yesterday and thrice a thousand years behind.<BR>
To-day was past and dead for me, for from to-day my feet had run<BR>
Through thrice a thousand years to walk the ways of ancient Babylon.<BR>
On temple top and palace roof the burnished gold flung back the rays<BR>
Of a red sunset that was dead and lost beyond a million days.<BR>
The tower of heaven turns darker blue, a starry sparkle now begins;<BR>
The mystery and magnificence, the myriad beauty and the sins<BR>
Come back to me.  I walk beneath the shadowy multitude of towers;<BR>
Within the gloom the fountain jets its pallid mist in lily flowers.<BR>
The waters lull me and the scent of many gardens, and I hear<BR>
Familiar voices, and the voice I love is whispering in my ear.<BR>
Oh real as in dream all this; and then a hand on mine is laid:<BR>
The wave of phantom time withdraws; and that young Babylonian maid,<BR>
One drop of beauty left behind from all the flowing of that tide,<BR>
Is looking with the self-same eyes, and here in Ireland by my side.<BR>
Oh light our life in Babylon, but Babylon has taken wings,<BR>
While we are in the calm and proud procession of eternal things.<BR>

The vanished hours of love that burn within the Ever-living still.<BR>

A SUMMER NIGHT<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
Her mist of primroses within her breast<BR>
Twilight hath folded up, and o'er the west,<BR>
Seeking remoter valleys long hath gone,<BR>
Not yet hath come her sister of the dawn.<BR>
Silence and coolness now the earth enfold,<BR>
Jewels of glittering green, long mists of gold,<BR>
Hazes of nebulous silver veil the height,<BR>
And shake in tremors through the shadowy night.<BR>
Heard through the stillness, as in whispered words,<BR>
The wandering God-guided wings of birds<BR>
Ruffle the dark.  The little lives that lie<BR>
Deep hid in grass join in a long-drawn sigh<BR>
More softly still; and unheard through the blue<BR>
The falling of innumerable dew,<BR>
Lifts with grey fingers all the leaves that lay<BR>
Burned in the heat of the consuming day.<BR>
The lawns and lakes lie in this night of love,<BR>
Admitted to the majesty above.<BR>
Earth with the starry company hath part;<BR>
The waters hold all heaven within their heart,<BR>
And glimmer o'er with wave-lips everywhere<BR>
Lifted to meet the angel lips of air.<BR>
The many homes of men shine near and far,<BR>
Peace-laden as the tender evening star,<BR>
The late home-coming folk anticipate<BR>
Their rest beyond the passing of the gate,<BR>
And tread with sleep-filled hearts and drowsy feet.<BR>
Oh, far away and wonderful and sweet<BR>
All this, all this.  But far too many things<BR>
Obscuring, as a cloud of seraph wings<BR>
Blinding the seeker for the Lord behind,<BR>
I fall away in weariness of mind.<BR>
And think how far apart are I and you,<BR>
Beloved, from those spirit children who<BR>
Felt but one single Being long ago,<BR>
Whispering in gentleness and leaning low<BR>
Out of its majesty, as child to child.<BR>
I think upon it all with heart grown wild.<BR>
Hearing no voice, howe'er my spirit broods,<BR>
No whisper from the dense infinitudes,<BR>
This world of myriad things whose distance awes.<BR>
Ah me; how innocent our childhood was!<BR>

She in eternal beauty may not bow<BR>
Thy troubles to efface<BR>
As in old time a head with gentle grace<BR>
All tenderly laid by thine<BR>
Taught thee the nearness of the love divine.<BR>
Her joys no more for thee<BR>
Than the impartial laughter of the sea,<BR>
Her beauty no more fair<BR>
For thee alone, but starry, everywhere.<BR>
Her pity dropped for you<BR>
No more than heaven above with healing dew<BR>
Favours one home of men&mdash;<BR>
Ah! grieve not; she becomes herself again,<BR>
And passed beyond thy sight<BR>
She roams along the thought-swept fields of light,<BR>
Moving in dreams until<BR>
She finds again the root of ancient will,<BR>
The old heroic love<BR>
That emptied once the heavenly courts above.<BR>
The angels heard from earth<BR>
A mournful cry which shattered all their mirth,<BR>
Raised by a senseless rout<BR>
Warring in chaos with discordant shout,<BR>
And that the pain might cease<BR>
They grew rebellious in the Master's peace;<BR>
And falling downward then<BR>
The angelic lights were crucified in men;<BR>
Leaving so radiant spheres<BR>
For earth's dim twilight ever wet with tears<BR>
That through those shadows dim<BR>
Might breathe the lovely music brought from Him.<BR>
And now my grief I see<BR>
Was but that ancient shadow part of me,<BR>
Not yet attuned to good,<BR>
Still blind and senseless in its warring mood,<BR>
I turn from it and climb<BR>
To the heroic spirit of the prime,<BR>
The light that well foreknew<BR>
All the dark ways that it must journey through.<BR>
Yet seeing still again,<BR>
A distant glory o'er the hills of pain,<BR>
Through all that chaos wild<BR>
A breath as gentle as a little child,<BR>
Through earth transformed, divine,<BR>
The Christ-soul of the universe to shine.<BR>

NOTE

<P CLASS="noindent">
As the mythological references made in a few poems may partially
obscure the meaning for those unacquainted with Celtic tradition, I
have appended here a brief commentary on the names mentioned.
</P>

<P CLASS="hang">
<I>Angus</I>, the Celtic Eros.  In the bardic stories he is described as a
tall, golden-haired youth playing on a harp and surrounded by singing
birds.  The kisses of these birds created love and also brought death.
</P>

<P CLASS="hang">
<I>Balor</I>, the prince of the dark powers.  His eye turned every living
thing it rested on into stone.  He was killed at the battle of Moytura
by Lugh the Sun-god.
</P>

<P CLASS="hang">
<I>Dana</I>, the Hibernian mother of the gods who were named from her Tuatha
De Danaan, or the Tribes of the goddess Dana.  They are also sometimes
called the Sidhe.
</P>

<P CLASS="hang">
<I>Etain</I>, a Celtic goddess who is the subject of a famous story, "The
Wooing of Etain."  She left the heaven world and became the wife of an
ancient Irish king.
</P>

<P CLASS="hang">
<I>Lir</I>, the Oceanus of Celtic mythology.  Probably the Great Deep or
original divinity from whom all sprang.  His son Mananan MacLir was the
most spiritual divinity known to the ancient Gael.  Lir is more
familiar as the father of the children who were changed into swans by
magic, and who lived for long ages on the waters around the Irish
coast.  The story of the fate of the children of Lir was probably in
its earliest form a mythological account of the descent of the spirit
from the Heaven-world to the Earth and its final redemption.
</P>

<P CLASS="hang">
<I>Lugh</I>, the great god of light who led the De Danaans at the battle of
Moytura, and who slew Balor of the Evil Eye by a cast from his sling.
He is a Celtic Hermes or Apollo.
</P>

<P CLASS="hang">
<I>Fomor</I>, the dark powers who were opposed to the hosts of light, the
Tuatha De Danaan.  They enslaved the latter for a time until the De
Danaans rose, led by Lugh the Sun-god, and defeated the Fomors in the
battle of Moytura.
</P>

<P CLASS="hang">
<I>Silver Hand</I>.  Nuada, one of the Danaan divinities, is called Nuada of
the Silver Hand.
</P>

<P CLASS="hang">
<I>Hound of Ulla</I>.  Cuculain, the great champion of the Red Branch cycle
of tales.
</P>

<P CLASS="hang">
<I>Sacred Hazel</I>, the Celtic tree of life.  It grew over Connla's Well,
and the fruit which fell from it were the Nuts of Knowledge which give
wisdom and inspiration.  Connla's Well is a Celtic equivalent of the
First Fountain of mysticism.  As an old story states, "The folk of many
arts have all drunk from that fountain."
</P>

<P CLASS="hang">
"<I>The three great waves</I>" are "the wave of Toth, the wave of Rury, and
the long, slow, white-foaming wave of Cluna."  In the bardic stories
these three mystical waves shout round the coast of Ireland in
recognition of great kings and heroes.
</P>

<P CLASS="hang">
"<I>The Feast of Age</I>," the druidic form of the mysteries.  It was
instituted by Mananan MacLir, and whoever partook of the feast became
immortal.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
